# flutter_gridview_example

This video will show you how to develop a Gridview in Flutter when it scrolls
down to the bottom to request more data from the server and show some
loading animation, then after lord that data into Gridview.
to do that, I use,
• GetX library.
• HTTP library for call REST API.
• Shimmer library for design loading card animation.
